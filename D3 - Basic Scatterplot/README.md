In this activity, we will plot the hair length of heavy metal bands from the 1980s versus their number of Billboard hits. The numbers in the dataset are made up. The bands themselves are very real.

## Instructions

1. Add chart axes.

2. Add labels for the axes.

3. Place data-bound circles on the chart.

4. Add tooltips and tweak the CSS properties to your liking.
